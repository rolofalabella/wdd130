        <p>I was born in Guatemala City, Guatemala and at the age of four my family moved to Virginia where I was
            raised. I served
            a mission at the age of seventeen, turning eighteen while in the Provo MTC. I served in the Denver Colorado
            North
            Mission for two years. After my mission I moved back to Guatemala where I now reside and am raising my
            family. I currently work at a tech company, reason why I've enrolled for a Software Development degree in
            BYU Idaho. My hobbies are playing basektball, spending time with my family, and learning new things in
            general.</p>

        <p>Guatemala is a beautiful mountainous country with an abundance of vegetation and lush forests. Guatemala is
            called the country of eternal spring due to it's warm weather. Its mayan culture houses some of the most
            spectacular pre-Columbian mesoamerican temples, among them the The Temple of the Great Jaguar.</p>
