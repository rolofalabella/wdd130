        <p>I was born in Guatemala City and at the age of four my family moved to Virginia where I was raised. I served
            a mission at the age of seventeen, turning eighteen in the MTC. I served in the Denver Colorado North
            Mission for two years. After my mission I moved back to Guatemala where I now reside and am raising my
            family.</p>

        <p>Guatemala is a beautiful mountainous country with an abundance of vegetation and lush forests. Guatemala is
            called the country of eternal spring due to it's warm weather. Its mayan culture houses some of the most
            spectacular pre-Columbian mesoamerican temples, among them the The Temple of the Great Jaguar.</p>
